Remove character
Send Feedback
For a given a string(str) and a character X, write a function to remove all the occurrences of X from the given string.
The input string will remain unchanged if the given character(X) doesn't exist in the input string.
Input Format:
The first line of input contains a string without any leading and trailing spaces.

The second line of input contains a character(X) without any leading and trailing spaces.
Output Format:
The only line of output prints the updated string. 
Note:
You are not required to print anything explicitly. It has already been taken care of.
Constraints:
0 <= N <= 10^6
Where N is the length of the input string.

Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
aabccbaa
a
Sample Output 1:
bccb
Sample Input 2:
xxyyzxx
y
Sample Output 2:
xxzxx



void removeAllOccurrencesOfChar(char input[], char c) {
    // Write your code here
    int i=0;
    int j=0;
    while(input[i]!='\0'){
      if(input[i]!=c){
         char temp = input[j];
          input[j] = input[i];
          input[i] = temp;
          j++;
          i++;
      }else{
         i++;
          
      }     
        
    }
input[j]='\0';
       
}
