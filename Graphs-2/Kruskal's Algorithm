Given an undirected, connected and weighted graph G(V, E) with V number of vertices (which are numbered from 0 to V-1) and E number of edges.
Find and print the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal's algorithm.
For printing MST follow the steps -
1. In one line, print an edge which is part of MST in the format - 
v1 v2 w
where, v1 and v2 are the vertices of the edge which is included in MST and whose weight is w. And v1  <= v2 i.e. print the smaller vertex first while printing an edge.
2. Print V-1 edges in above format in different lines.
Note : Order of different edges doesn't matter.
Input Format :
Line 1: Two Integers V and E (separated by space)
Next E lines : Three integers ei, ej and wi, denoting that there exists an edge between vertex ei and vertex ej with weight wi (separated by space)
Output Format :
Print the MST, as described in the task.
Constraints :
2 <= V, E <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
4 4
0 1 3
0 3 5
1 2 1
2 3 8
Sample Output 1 :
1 2 1
0 1 3
0 3 5

/**
 *  Kruskal's Algirithm:
 *  -------------------
 *  -   Helps to fund the MST i.e. minimum spanning tree.
 *  -   Steps:
 *      1.  Identify the edge with mininum weight.  
 *      2.  check if cycle is formed before adding the identified edge to the result.
 *      3.  if cylce found , identify next edge with minimum edge.
 *      4.  Repeat step 1-3 till we have n-1 edges in the result.
 *  -   Cycle Detection:
 *      -   Maintain what all vertices are already added to result.
 *      -   Ways to detect cylce.
 *          a.  Not a full proof way :
 *              -   If both the vertices of the edge is present in result means 
 *                  we have cycle. Because there can be chance that we don't have 
 *                  the cycle but both vertices are present in result.
 *          b.  Calculating the path between 2 vertices:
 *              -   We will check if any path present in both the vertices. If yes,
 *                  ignore it and check for next edge.
 *                      Time : O(E+V) of each vertices => E might be O(V^2) =>O(V^2)
 *                             O(V^3) for all vertices.
 *          c.  Union Find Algorithm:
 *              -   Maintain an array which store the parent of vertices starting with
 *                  parent same as the vertix.
 *              -   Check if both the vertices lies in different component and also
 *                  their topmost parent is different. If yes, we can connect the edge.
 *              -   Also made the changes in the parent array with the parent as any 
 *                  one of them.
 *                      Time : O(V) better than previous.
 *                             O(V^2) for all vertices.
